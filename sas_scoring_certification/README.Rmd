# Overview

Welcome to the NBT Sit and Stand (SaS) Scoring Certification folder (`sas_scoring_certification`). This folder includes code used for the additional training certification of SaS via a Shiny application. This application is intended to examine how examiners perform on a new set of SaS measures from the NBT.


# Folder organization

As of `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %Y')`, this folder contains a limited number of files used to create, score, and collect data from the Shiny application. Below is a brief description of the organization of the files and folders:

-   `app.R` - This file contains the primary code to run, score, and collect data from the Shiny application designed for scoring re-certification of SaS measures for those undergoing training on the NBT.

-   `deploy.R` - This file contains a the code used for deploying and terminating the Shiny application. 

-   `authentication_files` - This folder contains hidden files for authenticating the Shiny application for data collection. The file will appear blank on GitHub to keep the authentication information confidential. However, the file has been uploaded to show the structure to those interested in creating their own Shiny application.  

-   `sas_scoring_input` - This folder contains code  to clean, (re)score, and analyze SaS scoring certification data. The code in this file will not only produce an overall table to tell the individual overseeing certification how trainees are doing, but will also create individual reports that can be returned to the trainee.
