# Overview

Welcome to the NBT GitHub Repository. This repository includes a variety
of projects and code used for the development and training involved with
the NIH Infant and Toddler Toolbox (NIH BabyTB or NBT).

# What is NBT?

While there are several well-known assessment batteries for use by
children under the age of 4, there is no standardized direct
developmental assessments of infants and young children that is
inexpensive, easy to administer within a relatively brief time frame,
and able to capture multiple domains of neurodevelopment across this age
range. The NIH Infant and Toddler Toolbox (aka the “NIH Baby Toolbox” or
NBT) aims to develop, validate and norm an efficient, comprehensive
neurodevelopmental battery of measures for tablet based administration.
It will be specific for use by researchers and clinicians in the
neuropsychological, cognitive and social assessment of infants and
toddlers ages 1 – 42 months.

# Repo organization

As of April 2023, this repo is organized into two folders. Each folder
will have a README that explains the purpose of the folder as well as
the necessary steps to run and/or obtain the files in that folder. Below
is a brief description of the organization of the folders:

- `training_certification` - This folder contains the code to run the
  Shiny App designed for scoring certification for those undergoing
  training on the NBT.

- `dry_run` - This folder contains scripts related to obtaining,
  cleaning, and analyzing dats collected during the March 2023 Dry Run
  data collection. It also include scripts that show the results of
  these analyses.
